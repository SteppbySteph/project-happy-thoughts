# Happy Thoughts

This week we practiced on fetching API with useEffect to render a list of public posts. The task was also being able to like and post a message using a form. 

## The problem

A problem I encountered was clearing the input field after submitting a message. This was solved by adding an empty string in a function after fecthing and getting the response from the API. I also had difficulties to start working with the project after reading the course description. After doing some sketches on a piece of paper things became much more clearer and I could start working in VS code.
